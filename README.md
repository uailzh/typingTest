Typing Test Game

This Python script implements a typing test game using the curses library. Players are presented with a random line of text and are tasked with typing it as accurately and quickly as possible.
The game calculates and displays the Words Per Minute (WPM) to measure typing speed.

How to Play:
- Run the script in a terminal.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to start the game.
- Type the displayed text as accurately as possible.
- Your WPM (Words Per Minute) will be calculated and displayed in real-time.
- Press any key to play again after completing a round.
  
Features:
- Randomly selects lines of text from a file for variety.
- Calculates and displays WPM based on user input speed.
- Uses colors to highlight correct and incorrect input.

Customization:
Add more lines of text to the "text.txt" file for a diverse typing experience.
